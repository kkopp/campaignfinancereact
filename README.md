# Denver Campaign Data Project

Millions of dollars are contributed to candidates in Denver elections, but the city does not maintain a campaign-finance database that's easy to search. Rather, the city publishes Excel spreadsheets of this data. For our coding boot camp final project, we set out to create a website that makes it easy for voters to find information about campaign contributions and expenditures. Our goal is to help Denver voters make informed decisions.
